GAME OVER!!! 
*dead_emoji*
[UserName], you chose to quit the game!
Though you may part ways with the kingdom for now, fear not, your adventure will patiently await for you to return. Unfortunately, your progress will not be saved. Keep the fire of curiosity alive, and when the time is right, dive back into the realms of choice and consequence. Your tale, like an open book, eagerly anticipates the next chapter you'll inscribe. Until then, adios brave adventurer.
